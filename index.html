      <p>Hello, I am Tahsin Nazmee. I'm 21 years old. I was born in Wayne, New Jersey. I live in Cypress, Texas. I use to live in Michigan for 15 years. Then I moved to Austin, Texas during my sophomore year of high school. I have one little sister. My parents are from Bangladesh. My dad is an electrical engineer and my mom is teacher at Montessouri.</p>

      <p>I graduated at Vista Ridge High which is located in Cedar Park, Texas. I am majoring in Computer Science at University of Houston. My plan is to become a software engineer after I get my Bachelor's.</p>

      <p>I love playing basketball and working out at the gym with friends. I also love playing video games.</p>
